# GPIO_interfacing_RPi
This is a Raspberry Pi GPIO interfacing project.Here we make use of an led to make it blink.
Encouraged by Appiko

OBJECTIVE
  To blink LED.

INTRODUCTION
  This is a small project to make use of Raspberry Pi to show the GPIO interfacing.
  Here we make use of a small code written to blink LED.
  
WORKING
  Here I make use of python code to make the LED blink.
  I have two version of codes.One to make LED blink for a stipulated time period.
  Another is for an infinte time period.
  The circuit is set up such that is made of a resistor of 1Kohm and an LED in series such that a GPIO pin from microcontroller 
  is connected to the other pin of LED.
